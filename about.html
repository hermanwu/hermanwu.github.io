        <br>
        <div>
        <p>You can call me <b>Zeesun</b> <i>(pronunciation of my Chinese name)</i> or <b>Herman</b> <i>(yes, I picked it by myself when I was in elementary school)</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am a motivated and self-disciplined individual with huge learning appetite. Within only four and half years, I graduated from Georgia Tech with two Bachelor’s degrees both with the highest honors (Computer Science and Industrial Engineering), a minor in Philosophy, half a year of studying abroad experience in France, and a year of full-time internship/co-op experience at CafePress Inc in software development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After graduation, I spent a year and half working as software consultant and technical account manager, where I learned a lot about how to communicate with clients, teammates, and how to manage different projects. With experiences in full spectrum of technology industry, I believe that internet and software will continue to revolutionize our daily life. My variety of professional and academic experiences also made me realize that my true passion lies in utilizing my analytical and programming skills to create products and applications that will benefit people’s lives.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am constantly looking for new challenges and willing to relocate to any exciting metropolis, preferably the bay area, Washington DC, or Dallas.</p>
